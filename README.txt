This is a game written in 68000 assembly for the Programming I class at Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy. It was a two week assignment but I was able to spend only 5 days on it.

There are various simulators/emulators online that can be used to run this game, but my class used Easy68k:

I created all the code, art assets, dialogue, recording and music from scratch.
